  "Summary": "Peter F. Drucker’s article, \"Managing Oneself,\" explores the significance of self-awareness in achieving success in the modern knowledge economy. It proposes that, unlike previous generations who often had predetermined career paths, today's professionals must take personal responsibility for managing their careers. Drucker posits that deep self-knowledge—understanding one's strengths, learning styles, and values—is vital. He recommends practical tools such as feedback analysis, where individuals assess the outcomes of their decisions against their expectations to identify their true strengths and weaknesses. He emphasizes that relying solely on traditional performance and knowledge metrics often leads individuals astray, as many are unaware of how to leverage their unique capabilities effectively. Drucker argues that success stems not just from knowing what one is good at, but also from aligning one’s work style with the right environment, working relationships, and ethical values. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of proactive self-management throughout one’s career, particularly as professional lives become longer and expectations evolve. It highlights the necessity of adapting continuously to remain engaged, productive, and valuable in a rapidly changing work landscape. Essentially, Drucker calls for knowledge workers to adopt a mindset akin to that of a CEO, underscoring the need for individual agency in career development and success.",
