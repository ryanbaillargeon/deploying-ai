        "\n",
        "ChromaDB is an open-source vector database designed for storing and querying embeddings. Unlike traditional databases that search by exact matches or keywords, vector databases enable **semantic search** - finding items based on meaning and similarity rather than exact text matches.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts:\n",
        "- **Embeddings**: High-dimensional vectors (arrays of numbers) that represent the semantic meaning of text\n",
        "- **Collections**: Groups of documents with their embeddings and metadata\n",
        "- **Similarity Search**: Finding documents whose embeddings are \"close\" to a query embedding\n",
        "- **Metadata Filtering**: Combining semantic search with traditional filtering on structured data\n"

        "\n",
        "**Similarity Metrics**: ChromaDB uses cosine distance by default. The distance ranges from 0 (identical) to 2 (opposite). We convert it to similarity: `similarity = 1 - distance`, which ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 is most similar.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Performance**: Even with thousands of documents, semantic search is fast because ChromaDB uses efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms. The search doesn't compare against every single document - it uses indexing to quickly find candidates.\n"

        "- It focuses on direction (meaning) rather than length\n",
        "- It's normalized (ranges from -1 to 1)\n",
        "- It's efficient to compute\n",

        "- ChromaDB returns **cosine distance** (0 = identical, 2 = opposite)\n",

        "- In practice, most relevant results have similarity > 0.7\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Semantic Search Works**: Words with similar meanings produce similar embeddings. For example:\n",
        "- \"Python programming\" and \"coding in Python\" will have similar embeddings\n",
        "- \"tutorial\" and \"how-to guide\" will be close in vector space\n",

        "- Trade-off: Speed vs perfect accuracy (usually acceptable)\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Embedding Model Dependency**: Search quality depends entirely on the embedding model:\n",
        "- Different models produce different results\n",
        "- Model must match between insertion and querying\n",
        "- OpenAI's models are good but not perfect\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Language Support**: Embedding models work best in the language they were trained on:\n",
        "- English: Excellent\n",
        "- Other languages: Varies by model\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Query Length**: Very long queries may be truncated by the embedding model:\n",
        "- Most models have token limits (e.g., 8192 tokens)\n",
        "- Very long queries may lose nuance\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Metadata Filtering**: Some limitations:\n",
        "- Complex filters may be slower\n",
        "- Not all operators work with all data types\n",
        "- Date filtering can be tricky (strings vs timestamps)\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. No Full-Text Search**: ChromaDB doesn't do keyword matching:\n",
